---

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate understanding of:

- Supervised Machine Learning  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Model building and prediction  
- Performance evaluation using metrics  

This assignment implements five supervised learning algorithms on a dataset and compares their results.

## 📌 Problem Statement
To perform a prediction task (classification) using a suitable dataset and implement the following supervised machine learning algorithms:

1. Linear Regression (Logistic Regression for classification)
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model is trained, tested, and evaluated properly.

## 📌 Data Preprocessing Steps (Mandatory)

Before applying machine learning algorithms, the following preprocessing steps were performed:

### ✅ Handling Missing Values
- Checked dataset for null values.
- Filled missing values using mean (if any existed).

### ✅ Fixing Wrong Data Types
- Ensured all numerical features are stored as float values.

### ✅ Removing Duplicate Records
- Duplicate rows were detected and removed.

### ✅ Outlier Detection and Treatment
- Outliers were detected using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
- Extreme values were removed for better model performance.

### ✅ Encoding Categorical Variables
- Target labels were encoded using LabelEncoder.

### ✅ Feature Scaling
- StandardScaler was applied (important for KNN and SVM).

### ✅ Train-Test Split
- Dataset was split into:
  - 80% Training Data  
  - 20% Testing Data

## 📌 Evaluation Metrics

### Classification Metrics Used:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  

### Regression Metrics (If Regression Dataset Used):
- R² Score  
- MSE  
- RMSE  
- MAE

## 📌 Results and Model Comparison

All models were trained and evaluated on the test dataset.

Example output metrics:

- Random Forest and SVM achieved the highest accuracy.
- KNN performed well after scaling.
- Decision Tree worked but may overfit on small datasets.

A comparison table and accuracy bar chart were generated in:

- `implementation_requirements.py`

## 📌 Conclusion / Observations

- Proper preprocessing significantly improved model performance.
- Feature scaling was essential for KNN and SVM.
- Random Forest gave the best overall accuracy due to ensemble learning.
- SVM also performed strongly for classification problems.
- Logistic Regression provided a good baseline linear model.

This project successfully demonstrates supervised machine learning implementation with multiple algorithms and evaluation metrics.
