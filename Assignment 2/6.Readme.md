## ✅ Conclusion

In this project, we performed complete data preprocessing including data cleaning, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and additional transformations. Below are the key observations and final preprocessing choices:

---

### 1. Missing Value Handling

During preprocessing, missing values were handled using different strategies such as **mean**, **median**, and **mode** imputation.

- **Mean imputation** worked well for normally distributed numerical features.
- **Median imputation** performed best when the data contained **outliers**, because it is more robust and not affected by extreme values.
- **Mode imputation** was most suitable for categorical columns.

✅ Final Choice:  
We mainly preferred **median for numerical columns** and **mode for categorical columns** to ensure better stability and accuracy.

### 2. Categorical Encoding Techniques

Different encoding techniques were applied based on the type of categorical feature:

- **One-Hot Encoding** worked best for nominal features with fewer unique categories (e.g., City, Gender).
- **Label Encoding** was useful for binary categories but may introduce unintended order for multi-class features.
- **Ordinal Encoding** performed best for features with a natural order (e.g., Low < Medium < High).
- **Frequency Encoding** was effective for high-cardinality features where categories repeat often.
- **Target Encoding** provided better performance when categories strongly influenced the target variable, especially in supervised learning tasks.

✅ Final Choice:  
We selected encoding methods depending on the feature type to avoid unnecessary dimensionality and improve model performance.

### 3. Feature Scaling Method Effectiveness

Four scaling methods were demonstrated:

- **Min-Max Scaling** was effective when features needed to be bounded between 0 and 1.
- **Max Absolute Scaling** worked well for sparse datasets.
- **Vector Normalization** was useful for distance-based models such as cosine similarity.
- **Z-score Standardization** performed best overall because it transforms features to mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.

✅ Final Choice:  
We found **Standardization (Z-score)** to be the most effective scaling method for most machine learning algorithms.

### 4. Outlier Treatment and Skewness Transformation

Outliers were detected using statistical methods such as the IQR technique.

- Treating outliers helped reduce noise and improved feature consistency.
- Skewed numerical features were transformed using:
  - **Log Transformation** for heavily right-skewed data
  - **Power Transformation (Yeo-Johnson)** for making features more normally distributed

Key Observation:  
Reducing skewness improved data distribution and helped models perform better.

## ✅ Final Summary

Overall, the preprocessing pipeline successfully prepared the dataset for machine learning by:

- Handling missing values effectively
- Applying suitable categorical encoding methods
- Scaling numerical features properly
- Treating outliers and transforming skewed data

These preprocessing choices ensure better data quality, improved model accuracy, and reliable predictions.
