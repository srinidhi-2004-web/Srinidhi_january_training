## 6. Interpretation & Conclusion

- Linear Regression coefficients help understand the relationship between features and target variable (price).
- Positive coefficients indicate that increasing the feature value increases house price.
- Negative coefficients indicate that increasing the feature value decreases house price.

### Conclusion:
The Linear Regression model performed well in predicting house prices.
The evaluation metrics (MSE and R² score) confirm that the model fits the dataset effectively.
Key features like `sqft_living` strongly influence house price prediction.
